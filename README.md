# Website-App-Back-end
This was my proposal for the website/app for a start-up. The start-up company provides online personal trainers. They wanted to post videos of exercises and create plans for their customers. There was to be a website where personal trainers can login and be able to assign exercises, or send feedback to the customer. Implementing customer's login on the website was not required at the time.
The code has multiple classes combined into one file for readability. Only back-end code is provided here. 
For this project there was a need for a database to hold videos and records. Since accessing a database takes a long time, I decided to create temporary objects to store relevant information locally for quicker access and to minimize the number of times database is accessed.
